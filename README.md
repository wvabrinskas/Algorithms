# Algorithms
A list of algorithms I have worked on for fun and for learning. Here you will find the links to all the projects I've worked on. 

# Universal Support

## Neuron 
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/Neuron

Neuron is a swift package I developed to help learn how to make neural networks. This package provides a way to get started in machine learning. It allows for multiple input and outputs as well as customizing the number of nodes in the hidden layer.

## Feistel Cipher 
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/Swift-Feistel-Cipher

In cryptography, a Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers. A large proportion of block ciphers use the scheme, including the Data Encryption Standard (DES). The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule

## Farey Algorithm 
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/FareyAlgorithm

In mathematics, the Farey sequence of order n is the sequence of completely reduced fractions, either between 0 and 1, or without this restriction, which when in lowest terms have denominators less than or equal to n, arranged in order of increasing size. This sequence can be used to narrow down a decimal number to its corresponding fraction. 

# iOS Support

## Procedural Terrain Generation 1D, 2D, and 3D
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/Swift-Procedural-Terrain-Generator

Swift Procedural Terrain Generator creates organic terrain that is procedurally generated using the perlin noise algorithm. With some tweaking of the code it can generate 1 dimensional as well as 2 dimensional terrain graphs. The ability to switch between the dimensions hasn't been implemented yet. 

# macOS Support
## Genetic Algorithm 
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/Swift-Genetic-Algorithm

Using the genetic algorithm the macOS application will attempt to reconstruct the input word from a series of random guesses,ranking each result and learning. After the result is found you can view the graph of data points based on rank of each generation or output to a CSV. You can adjust a multitude of paramters to see how each variable effects the graph. 

## Image Parser 
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/ImageParser

Using a custom algorithm the app will find the average color of the image uploaded. 

# Swift CLI Support
- https://github.com/wvabrinskas/Swift-CLI-Password-Generator

Generate passwords using the cli. Completely written in swift.
